						<h2>Single Implant</h2>
						<p>Often, we wish to save money on the provisionals but we do not understand which is the best option for our case. If the area to treat needs aesthetic care, you should opt for a provisional fixed to the implant so that the gum is also remodeled. This will produce a better result between the aesthetic gum and tooth.</p>
						<p>In the case here presented we can understand the importance of a fixed provisional. See how the gum is healthy and with the correct shape for the definitive crown. In the second picture, we see the final result.</p>

						<h2>Internal Whitening</h2>
						<p>Teeth with root canal treatment undergo changes in shade over time and darken. One possible treatment is internal whitening. You may be able to get good results with this treatment before you even consider veneers or crowns. This treatment depends greatly on the tooth’s response to bleaching. It may not be possible to achieve the desired result and, in this situation, you should consult with your dentist and decide on veneers or crowns.</p>
						<p>The case here presented had an excellent response to the internal whitening treatment.</p>

						<h2>Implants Changing Smile</h2>
						<p>When most of the patient’s teeth are mobile and he has the possibility to change his whole smile, what should be done?</p>
						<p>The recommended treatment for this case was the placement of upper and lower implants and a fixed prosthesis over implants.</p>

						<h2>Dental mockup and provisional veneers</h2>
						<p>When you are not happy with your smile and want to close teeth gaps.</p>
						<p>Before you begin any treatment, you should explain very well to your dentist what you want and let your dentist analyse and study your case. He will present you with a mock-up, placed in your mouth, so you can imagine and evaluate the shape of your future teeth. If you are happy with this option, your dentist will then proceed to the treatment. </p>
						<p>The case here demonstrated is in the mock-up phase.</p>

						<h2>Onlay made in resin</h2>
						<p>When to choose an onlay or a filling?</p>
						<p>Often, the cavity has a high complexity (depending on the depth and size of the cavity) which causes the treatment not to be at the best quality if done directly with a filling, and the patient may have to stay longer in the chair for an acceptable result. An onlay has the advantages of reduced time in the chair for the patient  and a good adaptation between tooth and onlay, reducing fillings defect. At least two appointments are needed for the onlay treatment and there is the option of a resin of ceramic onlay, the decision of which will be made together with your dentist.</p>
						<p>The case here presented is an onlay made in resin.</p>
