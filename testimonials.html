									<blockquote>I was very nervous to go to another dentist that was not my previous one, but unfortunately he retired. My appointment went so well, I felt secure and very contented in Dr. Vera's hands. I found my dentist extremely professional and friendly. Dr. Vera diagnosed one of the causes of my grinding. I felt so much better after my bite balance treatment. I would highly recommend to my friends and family if they need any treatment. My overall experience has been a very pleasant one and I would have no hesitation in returning for more treatments. Thank you.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I went to see Dr. Vera, referred by a friend of mine. Dr. Vera understood perfectly what I wished for my smile makeover. I wished to change my 6 front crowns and would like to close a dark buccal corridor in one side of my smile. Dr. Vera gave me a treatment plan as well as a quotation that was very helpful to me. I was very nervous for the prep teeth but I trust 100% in my dentist. Everything was so relaxed and confortable. My provisionals looked so good that my friends and colleagues asked me if I did any work in my teeth. The final results are amazing. They look so natural, they match with the lower teeth. I am happy to have all this done by her. Thank you so much.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>When I first came to the clinic, I was physically shaking and in tears. I suffered from severe dental phobia and this was the firts appointment I had kept in 5 years. Dr Vera Oliveira immediately took me seriously and understood my anxiety and panic around dental treatment. Dr Vera took amazing care of me on my fisrt appointment even as I panicked mid-treatment. When my tooth was broken and came out with the impression gel, I cried and thinking I would be working/ socialising with a broken tooth. Within minutes, Dr Vera had a plan and I couldn't believe I was having an extraction- it was so painless and Dr Vera was so perfectly gentle calm with me. I can say with 100% confidence that I trust Dr Vera 100% to save my smile and she is hands down the best dentist I have ever had. I will follow Dr Vera from now on.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I have become Dr. Vera's patient in 2016 spring time after my implant surgery, whereby Dr. Vera has been assisting me in the adjustments and check-ups of the crowns and internal whitening of one tooth (with root canal treatment done many years ago), plus in other minor aesthetical issues. In my experience, Dr Vera has proved to be professional, friendly and caring. I can honestly recommend Dr Vera for her kind and competent attitude.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I have been for the first time to the clinic last week, I was indicated by one of my work colleagues, who was really pleased with the service provided by Dr. Vera. My appointment went so well, I felt secure and very contented in her hands. Dr Vera has a very professional approach to her customers, I never felt so comfortable in a dentist before, also by the fact that, I have been leaving in Dublin for the last 7 years and have not found a dentist like her. She will definitely see me soon, and look after my smile and also my boyfriend’s who is booking with her in the next few days. Many thanks again Dr. Vera, you definitely have a very happy customer here.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I have chosen Dr Vera Oliveira on the recommendation of a dental nurse friend for the purpose of an emergency treatment. In the process, implants became necessary for the desired outcome. I am most grateful to Dr Vera for her exceptional care and professionalism achieving this. I can, with confidence recommend Dr Vera Oliveira. Thank you for the friendly support. Initially on a recommendation, but knowledge of the extensive experience of the dentist made me decide to go ahead with the treatment. The initial consultation gave me a comprehensive overview of the treatment and I was offered several options. I felt genuinely cared about my welfare. At each visit I was made to feel welcome and that they were pleased to see me. I always feel like I’m in good hands here and that I will receive the best professional treatment available. I have already recommended Dr Vera to family & friends. Although I only have a temporary crown, the match with the others is excellent. Friends commented on how good the match is.</blockquote>

									<blockquote>I have just had my third visit with Dr Vera Oliveira. Having had a phobia of dentists for many years, I finally plucked up the courage to attend a dentist and was given an appointment with Dr Vera. On my first appointment, Dr Vera was able to make me feel relaxed and comfortable regarding the treatment she was about to do. On two further visits to Dr Vera, she also made me feel totally relaxed. It is my intention to continue to visit her and I would have no problem in recommending her to family and friends. I am very grateful and thankful to her.</blockquote>
